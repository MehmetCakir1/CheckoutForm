*In this project I used HTML and CSS to lay the page out.<br>
*I tried to use what I have learnt so far like flexbox layout and grid layout.<br>
*I learned how to change HTML content by using Javascript DOM.<br>
*I learned how to react to HTML DOM events.<br>
*I learned how to add and delete HTML elements.<br>
*This project was so beneficial to me.<br>
